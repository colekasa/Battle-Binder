# Battle-Binder


## Description

    Battle-Binder is a full stack application that utilizes Node.js, Express.js, SQL, and more to accomplish the task of building you a deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards based on your chosen favorites. When choosing a card as a favorite you are able to add this card to your deck and view it later by clicking on the "Favorites" button at the top of the screen. This project was developed by three junior developers who were learning on the fly as we built this application. 

    Of course there were speed bumps along the way that did slow us down a little. Some of the challenges faced were developing the correct Routes files and using Handlebars for the first time. With this new found experience as a team and as individuals we have become more diverse in our tools that we can use on future projects. 

    Some features that we would love to add in the future would be to delete the card from the deck so that if you decide that you do not like the card it can be removed. Another cool feature to add would be to add multiple Decks so that you can name them as you wish and create as many as you would like depending on your playstyle. 

## Languages 
    Node.js and Express.js were used to create a RESTful API.
    Handlebars.js was used as a the template engine.
    Bulma was used to style our Handlebars. 
    MySQL and the Sequelize ORM were used to create the database.
    With addition to these tools we used the MVC paradigm in order to created an organized folder structure. 
    Our application was deployed using Heroku. 

## Deck Building

    To start running the application all you will need to do is click on the link provided below since this application is hosted on Heroku. The homepage will then be the first page that is accessible. If all you are visiting for is to view our cards that is great we have a random card function that allows you to do just that on our homepage! If you are looking to create your own deck, the way to do that is to sign up and create an account that you can then login with at any time after. 
    
    After creating your account there are two ways to find cards that you like. The first way to expand your deck is found above where you can use our random card generator located on the homepage. The next way we implemented is by using the search bar that is located at the bottom of the homepage. Either way you will have plenty of cards to choose from in order to build a sufficient deck ready for battle!
